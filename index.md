### Intro

I am a Ph.D. student at MIT studying condensed matter physics. My advisor is [Prof. Nuh Gedik](https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/gedik_nuh.html).

### Research interests

I am broadly interested in studying novel phases of matter with second harmonic generation (SHG), which is a nonlinear optical technique sensitive to a material's point group. You can read more about SHG [here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4891417).

### Education

- 2017-Present : Ph.D. Massachusetts Institute of Technology
    - *Research assistant, Gedik group (2017-Present)*
- 2013-2017 : B.A. University of Pennsylvania
    - *Research assistant, Kikkawa group (2015-2017)*
    - *Research assistant, Aguirre group (2014)*

### Projects

- I wrote an open-source Python package called [ShgPy](https://bfichera.github.io/shgpy/) with a number of useful routines for analyzing SHG data.
